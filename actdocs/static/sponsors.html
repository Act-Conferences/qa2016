<a href="http://aws.amazon.com/de/"><img class="icon" width="400" src="[% make_uri('img/Logo-Amazon.png') %]" alt="Amazon Development Center Germany GmbH" title="Amazon Development Center Germany GmbH"></a><br>
The Amazon Development Center Germany GmbH develops innovative technologies for
Amazon Web Services (AWS). In 2006, AWS began offering IT infrastructure services
to businesses in the form of web services – now commonly known as cloud computing.
One of the key benefits of cloud computing is the opportunity to replace up-front
capital infrastructure expenses with low variable costs that scale as a business
grows. With the Cloud, businesses no longer need to plan for and procure servers
and other IT infrastructure weeks or months in advance. Instead, they can
instantly spin up hundreds or thousands of servers in minutes and deliver results
faster. The AWS platform has grown rapidly since the launch of the first service
and it is now the underlying infrastructure for businesses around the world from
start-ups to enterprises to government agencies.
